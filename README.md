# SQL queries #

## 1.  get all statuses, not repeating, alphabetically ordered

SELECT DISTINCT done          
FROM tasks WHERE done is NOT null          
ORDERED BY done;

## 2.  get the count of all tasks in each project, order by tasks count descending

SELECT projects.id AS projects_id, projects.name AS projects_name, COUNT(tasks.id) AS task_count     
FROM tasks     
LEFT JOIN projects ON tasks.project_id = projects.id          
GROUP BY projects_id, projects_name               
ORDER BY task_count DESC;

## 3.  get the count of all tasks in each project, order by projects names

SELECT projects.id AS projects_id, projects.name AS projects_name, COUNT(tasks.id) AS task_count           
FROM tasks   
LEFT JOIN projects ON tasks.project_id = projects.id                
GROUP BY projects_id, projects_name                                    
ORDER BY projects_name;

## 4.  get the tasks for all projects having the name beginning with “N” letter

SELECT id, name                
FROM tasks                     
WHERE name LIKE 'N%';

## 5.  get the list of all projects containing the ‘a’ letter in the middle of the name, and show the tasks count near each project. Mention that there can exist projects without tasks and tasks with project_id=NULL

SELECT projects.name AS projects_name, COUNT(tasks.id) AS tasks_count               
FROM projects      
LEFT JOIN tasks ON projects.id = tasks.project_id               
WHERE projects.name LIKE '%a%'                
GROUP BY projects_name;

## 6.  get the list of tasks with duplicate names. Order alphabetically

SELECT tasks.name AS name, COUNT(tasks.name)      
FROM tasks      
GROUP BY tasks.name       
HAVING COUNT(tasks.name) > 1         
ORDER BY name ASC;       

## 7.  get the list of tasks having several exact matches of both name and status, from the project ‘Garage’. Order by matches count

SELECT tasks.name AS task_name, COUNT(tasks.name) AS task_count              
FROM tasks       
LEFT JOIN projects ON projects.id = tasks.project_id                     
WHERE projects.name LIKE '%Garage'                         
GROUP BY tasks.name
HAVING COUNT(tasks.name) > 1                       
ORDER BY task_count;

## 8.  get the list of project names having more than 10 tasks in status ‘completed’. Order by project_id

SELECT projects.name AS projects_name, COUNT(tasks.id) AS task_count                   
FROM projects       
LEFT JOIN tasks ON projects.id = tasks.project_id                   
WHERE tasks.done='true'                   
GROUP BY projects_name HAVING COUNT(tasks.id) > 10;
